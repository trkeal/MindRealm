---=== Mindrealm 97a: v07 / FB32 1 to 1 ===---

=== Strategy Guide ===

1a. take the safe route and carefully avoid monsters
1b. or take the direct route and gather pickups

2a. lead your party with a far visioned player
2b. cast vision to randomly scout ahead

3a. rely on change of using brute strength to survive busting through gates
3b. chance tinker to pick locked doors

4a. chance randomly warping beyond barriers
4b. cast passage to randomly break through barriers

5a. cast Heal to rejuvenate your party
5b. cast Flare to randomly take out monsters

RNG can be a royal pain in MR. Sometime the monsters simply swarm, other times they hunt you down.

Some levels start in a sealed room. However, if you have the passage or warp spells. that issue is occasionally resolvable tho.
